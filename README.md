# Visible Light Communication System

Design files and software for a prototype full-duplex Visible Light Communication System completed as part of Electrical Engineering Design Project 2 course.

The VLC is based on the Li-Fi concept where light intensity is modulated to transmit digital signals.

The passing requirements for the VLC are:

- 50 Lumen Transmitter
- 0.1 m to 1 m operating range
- 20 degree off-boresight operation
- 1 kbit/s transmission rate
- BER less than 1%

This repo contains my contributions to the project with relevant acknowledgements to my group members.
